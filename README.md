> **🚀 First Public Beta Release** - A security gateway and monitoring platform for LLM APIs, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Registry.

## What is the AI Security Gateway?

The **AI Security Gateway** is a unified security platform that provides **real-time monitoring**, **policy enforcement**, and **threat detection** and a number of **new security controls** for Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Agent-to-Agent (A2A). It acts as an intelligent proxy layer between your applications and AI services and tooling, giving you complete visibility and security control over AI interactions and automations.

Think of it as a **security gateway** for your AI infrastructure - monitoring every request, applying various security policies, tracking usage, and ensuring compliance with your organization's security requirements. Although this is just a personal project for my own testing and needs its grown a lot and ready for more users.

#### Option 3: Frontend Deployment Options (Production)

For production deployments, you have two options for serving the frontend:

**A. Docker-based Frontend (Recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Start API server binary (as shown above)
./unified-admin &

# 2. Serve frontend via Docker + Nginx
# Frontend .env is already included in the release package
# Edit frontend/.env if needed to configure VITE_API_BASE_URL
docker-compose -f docker-compose.frontend.yml up -d
# Frontend available at http://localhost:80
```

**B. Manual Nginx/Apache Deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Build frontend for production
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# Frontend built to frontend/dist/

# 2. Deploy dist/ contents to your web server
# - Copy frontend/dist/* to nginx/apache document root
# - Configure reverse proxy for /api/* and /ws to backend:8080
# - See docs/web-server-deployment.md for detailed configs
```

**No Docker required for API server** - uses native Go binaries for optimal performance!
